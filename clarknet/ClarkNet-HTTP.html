<b>Description</b>
<dd>
These two traces contain two week's worth of all HTTP requests to the 
ClarkNet WWW server.  ClarkNet is a full Internet access provider for 
the Metro Baltimore-Washington DC area.

<dd>
The logs are an ASCII file with one line per request, with the following
columns:
<ol>
<li><b>host</b> making the request.  A hostname when possible, otherwise
the Internet address if the name could not be looked up.
<li><b>timestamp</b> in the format "DAY MON DD HH:MM:SS YYYY", where
<b>DAY</b> is the day of the week, <b>MON</b> is the name of the month,
<b>DD</b> is the day of the month, <b>HH:MM:SS</b>
is the time of day using a 24-hour clock, and <b>YYYY</b> is the year.
The timezone is -0400.
<li><b>request</b> given in quotes.
<li><b>HTTP reply code</b>.
<li><b>bytes in the reply</b>.
