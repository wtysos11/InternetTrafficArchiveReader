The Internet Traffic Archive
</h1>
The Internet Traffic Archive is a moderated repository to support
widespread access to traces of Internet network traffic, sponsored by
<a href="http://www.acm.org/sigcomm/">ACM SIGCOMM</a>.
The traces
can be used to study network dynamics, usage characteristics, and
growth patterns, as well as providing the grist for trace-driven
simulations.  The archive is also open to programs for reducing raw
trace data to more manageable forms, for generating synthetic traces,
and for analyzing traces.
<br> <br>
Traces contributed to the archive have no restrictions as to what
use may be made of them (except for traffic analysis as noted below).
Traces may however have restrictions on
redistribution.  Check the <em>Restrictions</em> information associated
with the trace.
<br><br>
Software contributed to the archive is in general copyrighted.
Check the <em>Restrictions</em> information associated with the
software for details.
<br><br>
Traces contributed to the archive often will have been filtered to
some degree to preserve the privacy of the network users whose traffic
was traced, and to address network security concerns.  The <em>Privacy</em>
information associated with the trace details these changes.
<em> Archive users agree to not perform traffic analysis aimed at
circumventing the degree of privacy present in a trace. </em>
